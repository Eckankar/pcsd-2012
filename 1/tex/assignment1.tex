Capacity and cost pr capacity data retrieved from EDBpriser.dk, Nov 29 2012.
Ram - 1 block at a time, no sets.

Reliability - read errors? Mean time to failure?


\subsection{Question 3, Performance}
\subsubsection{How does concurrency influence latency?}

The latency will be lower, if the overhead of scheduling, work partitioning and
other concurrency related overhead is less than the gain from parallelizing the
computation and vice versa. This will in practice favor larger computations and
datasets, while influencing smaller jobs negatively.

\subsubsection{What is the difference between dallying and batching?}

Batching is the act of performing several related actions simultaneously.
Dallying is the act of postponing an action, in order to later potentially batch
the action together with another related action, or maybe avoid doing it at all.

As an example, we can look at memory mapped files, where data is read from the
disk in batches (pages).
Write requests are dallied by only writing changes to ram, postponing disk
writes until strictly necessary, potentially batching several changes to a page
into one disk write.

\subsubsection{Is caching an example of fast path optimization?}

Caching exploits the fact that more frequently accessed items are more likely
to be in the cache. By this virtue, caching will often improve the common case
and is therefore an example of fast path optimization.

\subsection{Question 4, Experimental design}

Bla how to ensure cache hits / cache misses?
